## Description:
Buying a house is one of the biggest investments that many people make in their entire life. There are many real estate agents and websites, that help us with this process. There are many questions that come to our mind as well while planning to purchase a property like Term of Loan, Condition of House, Interest Rate, ReModeling Required, School Rating, Crime Rate in the area, Walking Score for the area etc.

We understand that buying a House to make it a Home or buying it for the purpose of investment is a very intense and exciting process. We may get carried away by emotions and may commit on a property without realizing the financial committment which needs to be made on the long run. We want to distill this information and make it user friendly from buyer perspective to evaluate if this would be a good investment and they can afford it comfortably.

Even though there is plethora of questions out there, we want to concentrate on providing a solution for the following three problems which the user would be debating:
What is the affordable price range of house that client should be looking for based on their current financial situation?
What is the downpayment that I should make?
Is this a good investment if you want to flip or considering it to rent?
What is the ROI of Property being considered over a period of 5-10-20-30 years?

To address the above problems, the website would assist in the following way:
1. Affordability
We will provide a mechanism by which the user would know if they are committing for a property well above a range that would be considered as risky based on their current financial situation. Also, the user would be provided insights into the property value that they should concentrate on to make their life easier and stress free.
2. Investment
The website will provide option for buyers who are planning to purchase a property with the intention of investment (ie either flipping the house over a short term interval or renting for a longer term)
